Based on [Morale Fiber Linked Double Crochet](https://moralefiber.blog/2018/02/02/linked-double-crochet-tutorial/)

Inspired by confusion with how to do the borders for [Morale Fiber Elf Coat](https://moralefiber.blog/2020/08/20/elf-coat-faq/).

## Challenges

For the Elf Coat, while the first row of the skirt border was obvious because it was completing the TKS of the row before, I was unsure where to attach the next row to. The example provided in the LDC tutorial showed it worked into a backloop in the round. The border was in the flat, so it was not going to end up the same. I ended up experimenting with scrap yarn for many hours until I found a solution I was happy with. The result that won out had very little curl because each row counter acted the row before. It also had two horizonal lines on every other row that looked like a pretty design choice. It was also much more uniform thickness than I would have expected, but the second loop used made a huge difference.

## What worked

- For all rows of Pin Stripe LDC after the first
    * Because this is worked in the flat, the front of the previous row is now the back of the current row. To avoid confusion in terminology, the front loop is the loop closest to you on the side you are working, not the front when the stitch was first created.
    * Identify the horizontal bar just below the front loop. When in doubt, this was the second to last loop of that stitch.
    * Whenever you need to insert into the stitch of the previous round,insert the hook from bottom to top, under the horizontal bar and the front loop, coming out between the front and back loop.
- If this is done in the round, the even number rounds will need to be mirrored stitches, as if an opposite handed person created them, to acheive the same pattern.

## Future goals and questions

- Document the mirrored version
