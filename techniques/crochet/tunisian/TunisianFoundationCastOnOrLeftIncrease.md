## References

Based on

but changes were needed to make it work correctly for Tunisian.

Inspired to create this method due to the need for pocket holes for the Morale Fiber Elf Coat
https://moralefiber.blog/2020/08/20/elf-coat-faq/
I was searching for a different method than what was recommended to give me a more normal edge with one piece of yarn.

## Challenges

First of all, the normal crochet cast on this is based on (referenced above) leaves you with the just the chain back bumps as your cast on stitches. Tunisian needs an additional stich in each of those to make it the same as a Tunisian foundation row.
Once that was overcome, I found the result was backwards from what a normal Tunisian foundation row looks like. This meant everything had to be mirrored to end up with the correct side in front. 
Finally, the last loop on the __casting hook__ had to be turned around as it was transferred to the __receiving hook__ at the end.

## What worked

- 2 hooks required.
    * __Receiving hook:__ A crochet hook long enough to receive the correct number of stitches.
    * __Casting hook:__ A crochet hook which will be only used for casting on. While I used the same size, in hindsight, I think a smaller hook would be preferred. How much smaller I will have to update on later.

In my successful tests, everything was loop under for the __casting hook__ and loop over for the __receiving hook__.

__WARNING:__ This should be practiced with scrap yarn several times before using good yarn.

1. Start with an initial loop on the __casting hook__.
    - If this is not an increase, you may want to even create your slipknot with looping under too maintain that direction throughout the bottom chain.
    - If this is an increase, keep in mind that this loop will be part of the bottom of the stitches.
    - If using mid row, you may want to pull the first loop up from the chain of the previous row
2. Holding both hooks in the right hand vertically, the __receiving hook__ should be on the left and the __casting hook__ should be on the left. The yarn should be in front of the __receiving hook__.
3. Wrap the yarn from the front to the left and around behind the __receiving hook__. It would be clockwise if looking down from the hooks.
4. Loop under the _casting hook__. This will be coming forward between the hooks and to the right around the __casting hook__.
5. Pull through the loop on the __casting hook__. This will result in a chain with the __receiving hook__ in the back bump. The working yarn should be behind at this point.
6. Turn the work over to the right. It may help to also turn it CCW 30deg or more so you are holding it with more of a normal crochet angle.
7. Yarn over the __receiving hook__ and pull through 1 loop.
8. Turn the work over to the left to look at it the original direction.
9. Bring the yarn forward between the hooks.
10. Repeat 3 to 9 as needed until you have one less than the number of stiches you need on the __receiving hook__.
11. Yarn under the __casting hook__, without wrapping the __receiving hook__ and pull through the loop on the __casting hook__. This forms the base of the turning chain.
    - If this is creating a mid-row hole, you may do this step as a slip stitch in the chain before where the next normal stitch would go, inserting the hook from back to front, opposite of the direction done with the loop created for step 1.
12. Bring the yarn forward between the hooks.
13. Rotate the hooks in opposite direction until the hooks are pointed at each other.
14. Transfer the loop on the __casting hook__ to the __receiving hook__. The yarn should end up behind the work, between the last and second to last loop.
16. Continue as normal.

## Observations

- From the hooks' initial positions, yarn movement occurs with coming forward between them and then outwards to go around them.
- The __receiving hook__ gets wrapped around twice for every one time the __casting hook__ does.
- The previous loop on the __casting hook__ is difficult to tighten once the stich on the __receiving hook__ has been completed, so keep tension tight throughout for the __casting hook__. Perhaps a smaller casting hook could/should be used.

## Future goals and questions

- Is there a way to do the same thing with one hook?
- Is there a way to hold the two hooks that is easier?
- Add pictures for the explaination.
- The resulting cast on loops seemed a bit large, even with keeping a tight tension. A smaller __casting hook__ might solve this, but what should the ratio be?
