Long tail cast based on [Judy's Magic Cast On](https://knitty.com/ISSUEspring06/FEATmagiccaston.html).

Short tail cast based on [Turkish Cast-on](https://nimble-needles.com/stitches/how-to-knit-the-turkish-cast-on/).

Inspired to create this method due to the need for pockets for the [Morale Fiber Elf Coat](https://moralefiber.blog/2020/08/20/elf-coat-faq/). I was searching for a different method than what was recommended because I don't sew but can do joins as I go like a champ. At first I was going to try to join as I go on both sides, but then I realized that this was a great oportunity to try tunisian in the round. I then thought of my favorite way to start knit socks.

## Challenges

- The first challenge is that I haven't touched knitting in many years, so I have forgotten most of the techniques I am referencing and had to relearn them.
- After a lot of experimenting, going back and forth between Judy's Magic Cast-on and the Turkish Cast-on, I ended up with 2 methods.
- On the initial test of the Turkish Cast, I lost a stitch after removing the initial slip knot, so I included the importance of locking that tail down with the RP.
- Tunisian crochet and regular knit loops are backward from each other, so the direction of the initial wraps had to account for this. I went through many iterations to find what would avoid twisted stiches and the "What worked" section describes the results.
- Short tail method based on the Turkish cast-on worked great with a test of an initial 8 wraps. Unfortunately, when trying to do the same thing with 19, I ended up with severe tension issues. Using what I learned from the Turkish method, I finally found the correct way to wrap for Judy's Magic Cast On and where to return pass for that method. This fixed all the problems I had when I went from a test width of 8 (16 sts) to the good yarn working with a width of 19 (38 sts). I've left the Turkish method as a "short-tail" section with a note recommending the "long-tail" method. I'm keeping the short-tail method in this file only for reference because it is easier to understand how it works.

## What worked

- 2 hooks connected by a long flexible cord.
    * __FP hook:__ The forward pass crochet hook.
    * __RP hook:__ the reverse pass crochet hook.
    * The cable length is recommended to be about 5 times the length of one of the hooks to comfortably double back on itself as required for this technique. I am using 6" hooks with a 30" cable and it seems just about right.
- 2 balls of yarn to work from
- locking stitch markers (3 if they are similar or 2 if one really stands out as important)
- Optional: double sided hook (no cable) to switch to after the halfway point of the second round. This makes going back and forth between forward pass and reverse pass much easier.

__WARNING:__ This should be practiced with scrap yarn several times before using good yarn.

#### Short-tail cast

__WARNING:__ This method can work for a small number of initial stitches. If you need more than a width of 8 (16 sts), I highly recommend using the [long-tail cast](#long-tail-cast) below to avoid really bad tension issues, where all your slack ends up on one end. This short tail cast is the more difficult method between the two. I've included it because it can be used as a reference to understand what the long-tail cast method is doing.

1. With ball 1 of the yarn, tie a slip knot around the __FP hook__. This slip knot is temporary and is used to keep you from losing stitches until the tail is secured later.
1. Hold both hooks parallel, pointing left, with the __FP hook__ on the bottom and the __RP hook__ on the top. The yarn should be behind.
1. Wrap the yarn around both hooks in a yarn over direction.
1. Repeat until you have the desired number of loops, not counting the initial slip knot. The more stitches you have the looser your wraps will need to be. The beginning wraps can be tighter than the ending wraps as the slack will get transfered down the work as you go.
1. Bring the yarn forward between the two hooks.
1. Turn the hooks so the hooks are pointing to the right and __RP hook__ is on top and the working yarn between the hooks is behind.
1. Slide the loops on the __FP hook__ down the cable and turn the __FP hook__ so you can work off the loops on the __RP hook__.
1. Insert the __FP hook__ into the fist loop on the __RP hook__ from right to left.
1. Taking care to leave the same amount of slack that exists in the loop you are working into, yarn over the __FP hook__ and pull through.
1. Pull the loop off of the __RP hook__. Yes, we are treating our hooks like knitting needles right now, but only for this first forward pass.
1. Continue working all the loops off the __RP hook__. You should have half the foundation forward pass stitches on the __FP hook__.
1. Slide the stiches around the cable so the other half of the initial loops are on the __RP hook__ and the completed foundation stitches are still on the __FP hook__.
1. This will put you at the same place as the end of the long tail cast section. Jump to the "Complete Foundation Round" section to continue.

#### Long-tail cast

Preferred method, especially when you need more than a width of 8 (16 sts).

1. With ball 1 of the yarn, measure out the long tail. This can be done by taking the spot you would normally put a slip knot and loosely wrap the yarn around one of the hooks the number of stiches wide, half the total stitches, needed. It is recommended to wrap in a yarn over direction to prevent untwisting of most yarn for this step.
1. Unwrap the hoooks once you have your measured start point on the yarn.
1. With the __RP hook__, at the measured out location on the yarn, lay the yarn over the hook, with the working part in front and the tail in back. Hold it in place with your right hand (thumb recommended) until you have a few loops completed.
1. Hold both hooks parallel, pointing left, with the __FP hook__ on the top and the __RP hook__ on the bottom. The yarn should be behind, only around the __RP hook__.
1. With your left hand, hold both strands, laying the tail over your index finger and the working yarn over your thumb.
1. Start with the working yarn around your thumb, yarn over the top __FP hook__, wraping forward around the outside above the hooks and back between the hooks.
1. Then, using the tail yarn around your index finger, yarn over the bottom __RP hook__, wrapping forward between the hooks and back around the outside beneath the hooks.
1. Repeat the previous two steps until you have the number of required loops.
1. End with an extra loop on the __RP hook__. This last loop will not be used, but is to ensure the last loop on the __FP hook__ doesn't get lost. Secure this extra loop with a slip knot on the __RP hook__.
1. This will put you at the same place as the end of the short tail cast section.

#### Complete Foundation Round

1. Double check your count here because this is the easiest place to catch big mistakes that will cause you to have to start over. There should be the same number of loops on the hooks, plus the extra slip knot on the __RP hook__. This also gives you an opportunity to try and fix tension throughout, especially if you have a count over 10-ish that can be difficult to resolve.
1. Mark the loop on the __RP hook__ that is next to the slip knot with either 2 stitch markers or a more important looking marker. This loop is your start of round. You have already completed the forward pass for this round.
1. Mark the first stitch (right-most) on the __FP hook__. This loop is your start of the second half. Both of the marked points can be difficult stitches to find in the first few rounds and can get hidden by the reverse pass. They are also important for determining shaping patterns. Mark them early and often, especially in the first few rounds.
1. Slide the stiches down from the __FP hook__ onto the cable so you can work just with the __RP hook__.
1. Slip off the inital slip stitch. This loop will not be retained, but make sure the tail is secured in at least the next couple of stiches worked before you lose track of it. This is a risky step because the last stich on on the other side is easy to unravel if you lose track of the tail too soon. Yes, be afraid. It keeps you alert.
1. With ball 2 of the yarn, yarn over the __RP hook__ and pull through, making sure to keep the marker(s) behind the work (on the RS because WS facing you).
1. With the __RP hook__, yarn over and pull through 2 loops, making sure to trap both tails in this stitch.
1. It is recommended to double check the start of round mark at this point to make sure you can find the correct stich later.
1. Continue normal return pass until there is 2 or 3 loops remaining, sliding the work around as needed. You should never have less than 2 loops from here on, but a min of 3 is recommended.

#### Round 2

1. Switch to the __FP hook__, sliding the work around as needed.
1. Work the loops from the initial cast on in TKS, moving markers as needed. The stitch just before the mid point mark can be especially difficult to find, so be sure to check your count so you don't miss it.
1. Switch to the __RP hook__, as needed to reduce tension or to complete the round, by performing return pass or extended return pass (chain 1 between each YO pull through 2) until there are 3 loops remaining, sliding the work around the cables as needed.

#### Optional

- At any point after the you are past the halfway marker of Round 2, you can transfer to a double sided hook to make it easier to go back and forth between the FP and RP hooks.
-  If an extended return pass is desired, it is not advised to start it before Round 3.

### For toe shaping

#### Round 3

1. Switch to the __FP hook__ and continue from the previous row without joining. Make sure you do not skip the first stitch as you normally would when working in the flat.
1. TKS, TKS inc in next sp, TKS until there is only one stitch before the midpoint marker, TKS inc in next sp, TKS
1. Switch to the __RP hook__ and continue return pass until there is 2 loops on the hook. This can be done as needed going forward, as long as there is never less than 2 loops on the hook.
1. TKS, TKS inc in next sp, TKS until there is only one stitch before the start of round marker, TKS inc in next sp, TKS
1. Move markers as needed.

#### Round 4

1. TKS all stitches with __FP hook__.
1. RP as needed with __RP hook__.
1. Move markers as needed.

#### Remaining rounds as needed
Repeat Round 3 and 4, increasing 4 stitches every other round, until the total number of stitches or desired width has been reached.

## Observations


## Future goals and questions

- [ ] Add pictures for the explaination.
- [ ] Experiment with extended return pass for a better understanding of when added horizontal flexibility might be needed.
- [x] Should I attach the pockets RS in or RS out? The Elf Coat pattern does it RS out, but I'm not sure why. That seems backwards to me. Maybe it will make more sense once I have one completed 
    * I went with RS in
